                            <h3>Senior Consultant | Metrolinx | Toronto, ON | Oct 2017 - Present</h3>
                            <div id="Exp6" style="display: none; text-align: justify;" class="normalText">
                                Currently I am working as a senior consultant on contract at Metrolinx – a Crown agency that manages and integrates road and public transport in Ontario.
                                <br />I used Azure Data Factory, Function App, Logic App, Pipeline, Integrated Runtime, Linked Service, Azure SQL Server on CDH project. I worked in an agile team with cutting edge technologies like GitHub CICD, Rabbit MQ, Mongo DB, Redis cache, ASP .NET Core.

                                <br /><br /><b>Central Data Hub (CDH)</b>
                                <br />CDH was built to create a data hub having Rail, Bus and UP express schedule data including delay and dispatch measure information. The downstream systems like On The Go (OTG) alerts, Public Announcement (PA), etc. would use the CDH. I used Azure resources like Data Factory, Linked Service, Function App, React JS for this project.

                                <br /><br /><b>On the Go Alerts (OTG)</b>
                                <br />OTG was built so the Metrolinx users can subscribe to Train & Bus alerts. I was part of backend team. I used Logic App to consume the events from CDH and push data to SalesForce that send notification to end users.

                                <br /><br /><b>Customer WiFi</b>
                                <br />I worked on agile team to improve data quality of customer Wi-Fi data so downstream Cloudera team can generate reliable reports. I did RabbitMQ improvements, implemented API call retries, DB write failure retries. I created DevOps Pipelines & Releases to deploy website and web API to different environments.

                                <br /><br /><b>Trip Management System (TMS)</b>
                                <br />I worked with the agile team to implement TMS for USBT Bus station. I worked on the backend consuming Siri Estimated Time (ET) and Vehicle Monitoring (VM) packages to update schedule information like departure time. I successfully integrated and tested end-to-end solution with third party vendor called IDOX.

                                <br /><br /><b>Schedule Manager (SM)</b>
                                <br />I worked on SM to improve the process of Uploading Hastus data, CAD/AVL Bus export by adding data validation, user friendly error messages.

                                <br /><br /><b>Admin Manager (AM)</b>
                                <br />As a part of CCMS changes, I worked on AM to add some Configuration and Rules for S4 channel. User can set this Configuration in AM so the CCMS user will be able to see different options on the base of this configuration. Same way the user can set this Rules in AM so the CCMS user will be able to take certain action on the base of this rules and displayed the error message as configured in AM if user select wrong combination of selection on CCMS GUI.

                                <br /><br /><b>Trip Manager v3 (TM3)</b>
                                <br />I worked with the agile team to do performance fine tuning of the TM3 to reduce the initial page load time. I reduced the SQL query time from 22 seconds to under 2 seconds.

                                <br /><br /><b>Trip Manager 4 (TM4)</b>
                                <br />TM4 was built to add new features to older version of Trip Manager. It used latest technologies like Rabbit MQ, Mongo DB, Redis cache, ASP .NET Core 2.0, React/Redux. We used Serilog’s Rolling File Sink and Global Exception Handling for error logging. TM4 is used by the Metrolinx team in the control room to see Trip, Engine, Consist, Station, Yard information. The team member can take different measures (cancel trip, restore stop, create equipment move, etc.) and also create/edit Events in the system. We used “Command and Query Responsibility Segregation” (CQRS) and “Domain Driven Design” (DDD) pattern to build microservices. SignalR was used to send notification to all connected clients. I was responsible building and maintaining a microservice that consume Rabbit message and update the legacy system. Once the update is complete, the microservice send the event that can be consumed by down stream microservices. It also sends the notification that can be consumed by the frontend web application – that can notify all connected clients.

                                I worked as a senior consultant on contract at Allianz Global Assistance – a travel insurance company.
                                <br /><br /><b>PPO Network Optimization</b>
                                <br />This was an internal project to build a tool that help Allianz figure out the best Network on the base of weighted average of historical claim reprice data. I was responsible for creating database schema, rule engine & integration with legacy insurance system. This tool has a front-end web application to manage Provider & Network profiles, Client participations and worklists. The back end is there to run nightly job, weighted average discount calculations and integration with legacy insurance system that does actual repricing. I used Git, ASP .Net Core 1.1, MS Visual Studio 2017 and MS SQL Server.
                                <br /><br /><b>Claims Portal (<a href="https://portal.allianz-assistance.ca" target="_blank">https://portal.allianz-assistance.ca</a>)</b>
                                <br />Claims Portal web application was built so that an insured can go online and file/submit a claim. I was responsible for creating backend including a staging database, web API for database communication and console application for legacy insurance system integration. This web application uses wizard process where an insured enters claim details on each step of wizard. At the end the web application generates a case number and send out email notification to claimant. Claimant can use this case number to check the status (Paid/Partially Paid/Rejected) of claim.

I coordinated with business analyst, project manager, in house QA team and BMO UAT team to meet project deadlines. We used TFS to log our work items for weekly sprint and track bugs.
                                <br /><br /><b>OSFI Load Sanction process</b>

I also designed and coded Outlook scheduling module that is used to schedule candidate interviews and to see Free/Busy status of hiring managers/recruiters. As it is universally accepted, I used iCal format to send meeting invites.

                                <br />I integrated import LinkedIn profile feature in legacy system using LinkedIn API. Using this feature a candidate can pre-populate the Njoyn profile from LinkedIn. I also integrate video interviewing feature into Njoyn using Kira talent’s API. Using this feature a recruiter can setup video interview with candidate.
